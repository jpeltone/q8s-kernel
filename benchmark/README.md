# Simple benchmark

## Prepare the tests

Adjust the algorithm in the notebook and the number of qubits in `benchmark.py`. Then run the benchmark with:

```bash
python benchmark.py
```

The benchmark will use the kernel configured in the notebook.

The results are available in `results.csv`.

## Visualize the results

The notebook `plot.ipynb` can be used to visualize the results.
